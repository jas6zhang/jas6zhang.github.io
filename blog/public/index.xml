      <title>Why Write</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing was something that I always hated to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Words did not come natural to me and going through the process felt like a chore. Writing was like building a structure where I would slap on the roof first, and then realize that I had no pillars supporting the structure in the first place. Ideas formed in my head, but I struggled to link words together to produce a well-formed sentence. This often resulted in half-baked sentences where I end up with  gaps in between parts of a sentence, waiting to be filled later on with words that I pull from a Thesaurus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
