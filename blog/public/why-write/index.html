  <p>Writing was something that I always hated to do.</p>
<p>Words did not come natural to me and going through the process felt like a chore. Writing was like building a structure where I would slap on the roof first, and then realize that I had no pillars supporting the structure in the first place. Ideas formed in my head, but I struggled to link words together to produce a well-formed sentence. This often resulted in half-baked sentences where I end up with  gaps in between parts of a sentence, waiting to be filled later on with words that I pull from a Thesaurus.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two reasons why my writing skills are just not up-to-par. First, being natively bilingual is something that I&rsquo;m very appreciative of, but I can also see how it limited some of my ability to communicate specificially in English. Not only did I often have to context switch between different grammars and vocabulary, but I simply just didn&rsquo;t spend enough time practicing the language compared to those who were monolingual. Second, I have an inherent of fear of writing and being judged for producing not-so-perfect writings. I saw writing as a reflection of each person, and anything less then perfection would represent myself poorly. But, this is simply a terrible mindset to go about writing. Writing is sharing a part of yourself with others, and it&rsquo;s ok if the written piece is awkward and terrible, because like everything about the human experience, it&rsquo;s an evolving process.</p>
<p>Writing is powerful and liberating. Someone who can freely communicate their thoughts without internal judgment fear of what others might think is someone who is free. By producing these written pieces, I hope this is the start of something that I can use to confront my fear. So this is me practicing—one piece at a time.</p>
